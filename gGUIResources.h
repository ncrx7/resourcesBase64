/**
 * gGUIResources keeps all images in base64 format that the programmer can use
 * in their software thanks to their getter functions. We keep this data as
 * base64 because asset images may be lost or corrupted in the file.This results
 * in loss of image and bad experience for a developer. All the images have
 * their own getter function and this getter functions return base64 string
 * value of the image.
 *
 * There are 2 types of getter functions in this class. The first of them is
 * getBase64Icon... function. This function provides us to get base64 string of
 * an image. Also every image has their own getBase64Icon... function. We use
 * these functions inside the initialize function as parameters of the decode
 * function. gDecodeBase64 is a function that converts the base64 string sent
 * into the decode function to image data. Thanks to initialize function, we can
 * add image that we decoded to gImage array that we created.Thus, we will be
 * able to use any image we want in other classes.
 *
 *
 * HOW TO USE
 * - First of all, you have to create a getter function that containing its own
 * name in gGUIResources.h file. (Ex :std::string getBase64IconFile16(); )
 *
 * - After that, you have to enumeration procces to determine id of image which
 * you want to add. (Ex : ICON_FILE,(in the enum))
 *
 * - You have to define the body of your getter function in gGUIResources.cpp.
 * And this function have to return base64 string of your image.(You can encode
 * your image by using encode function of GlistEngine)
 *
 * - Examples of encoding procces in a canvas :
 * img.loadImage("Copy.png");
 * gLogi("base") << "base64img:" << gEncodeBase64(img.getImageData(),
 * img.getWidth() * img.getHeight() * img.getComponentNum());
 *
 * - After you define body, go to initialize function and set your image to array
 * by using id of your image.Don't forget that you have to use decode function
 * inside setImageData function. Also, gDecodeBase64 have to  contain getter
 * function of your image. (Examples avaible below)
 *
 * - After we add the image to array, we can use this image in every class we
 * want. To be able to use it, we have to create an object from gGUIResources
 * class (Ex: gGUIResources res;) and have to use getIconImage method of this
 * object  ( Ex : res.getIconImage(gGUIResources::The id which you enumeration)).
 * Don't forget to add res.initialize(); function to the constructor of your class.
 * This function makes the initialize function of gGUIResources class work.
 *
 * To draw this use draw function (Ex : res.getIconImage(id)->draw(....). If you
 * want the users to choose the images by using your class. You have to define
 * imageid variable as a parameter of getIconImage in your class. Define a
 * function that get id information from developer user to your class and
 * defines it into the iconid variable in your class. Thus, users can use the
 * icons which you add by using the function you define to get id from users in
 * your class.
